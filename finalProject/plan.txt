We now have an outline of our final map
The outline really only takes up a portion of the LENGTHxLENGTH grid
Compute the size of that portion; each unit corresponds to 8 tiles

Save the upperleft and lower right corners
Allocate a widthxheight(x8) data grid
For every node,
	Retrieve its upperleft corner (functions as the uv-coordinate)
	Offset by upper left corner of portion
	From node's room variant, determine the room's dimensions
	Copy the corresponding tile data from levelSheet

We now have the skeleton of the level

Pickups, player, enemies
Each room variant has a structure of Corners:
	anchor
	PlayerStart
	pickup
	enemy1
	enemy2
	enemy3
