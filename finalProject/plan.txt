We now have an outline of our final map
The outline really only takes up a portion of the LENGTHxLENGTH grid
Compute the size of that portion; each unit corresponds to 8 tiles

Save the upperleft and lower right corners
Allocate a widthxheight(x8) data grid
For every node,
	Retrieve its upperleft corner (functions as the uv-coordinate)
	Offset by upper left corner of portion
	From node's room variant, determine the room's dimensions
	Copy the corresponding tile data from levelSheet

We now have the skeleton of the level
Now we need to place the player: somewhere in node 0.
Place enemies:
	Hoppers, runners, fliers are randomly placed based on levelSheet
	Boss is put in one of the large leaves/cubbies
Placing doors:
