Doors are left-centric
In the template, every room that opens to the right has an entity marker

To assign color to those doors, work our way from leaf to root
	We have a parent and a child
	FInd out which is to the left; call it leftRoom
	If leftRoom is a quad, discover which door connects with rightRoom
	Otherwise, it is door1
	
	if the starting leaf is the boss room,
		the door must be blue
		every other door going up is random
	if a weapon upgrade,
		the door must be weaker
		every other door going up is weak too
	otherwise, random
