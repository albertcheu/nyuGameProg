After making the level tree, Generator assigns orientation/variation
	Leaves/"cubbies"
		Left/right small
		Left/right large
	Path
		Platform
		No platform
	Quad (only one kind)

struct{
bool topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight
} availableSpace

Pair every node with an availableSpace structure.
Quads use all 4 slots, Paths use the first two, Cubbies one of the the first two
Initialize all to false

Root must be a small cubby
	If left cubby, topRight = true
	Else, topLeft = true
Push in queue
Traverse the tree in BFS order:
	Pop node x
	for every availableSpace:
		mark it as unavailable
		Open up available space for child
		Close a slot that links with x (special restriction for quad-quad)
		Push child in queue
