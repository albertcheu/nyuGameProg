Each flare file has a name of the form <format><0-10>.txt
	<format> gives the number of doors of a room and its shape
		left/rightCubby (one door)
		shortPath (two doors)
		longPath (two doors)
		shortQuad (four doors)
		tallQuad (four doors)
		boss (two doors)
	<0-9> permits me to create multiple variants of the same format
		0: Start
		1: End
		2: Yellow pickup
		3: Green
		4: Blue
		5: Logbook
		6: Energy tank
		7-9: Variable (blank or enemy)
		10: Boss

We require that there be:
	a starting point and an end point
	0-6 are cubbies
	7-9 are either "-Path" or "-Quad"

	one path from start to end that
		contains at least one blue door
		has a length from 3-6
		whose penultimate room is the boss room

	places to pickup the four weapon upgrades (one each)
	a path of red doors to yellow pickup, etc.

	places to pickup the <number of> logbooks
	4 places to pickup energy tanks


LevelMaker constructs a graph of flare filenames:
	Vertices are 0-9, edges are colored RED-BLUE
	Create vertices 0, 10, and 1 with a BLUE edge between 0 and 10
	(From now until I say so, add RED edges)
	Add Variable vertices between 0-10
	Create vertices 2, 3, and 4
